         <p>Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared the
            cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,” according
            to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically, the vault and
            gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are also worried about
            structural damage that may be hidden.

         <p>Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture
            with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in structural
            engineering, said the transept is probably the greatest vulnerability. To ensure
            the structure is stable, additional shoring may be necessary after the full
            extent of the damage is assessed.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is susceptible
            to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some damage to the stone,
            even the places that currently appear to be intact . . . because of the weaknesses
            of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a big unknown. . . . I don’t think anybody
            knows the extent of that damage.”

            strikes there it can be devastating to a particular community or a particular
            group of people, and sometimes it doesn't get the attention it deserves.”

         <p>French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame within
            five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical that timeline
            will be met, even with the number of resources being promised for restoration.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/yesterday-notre-dame-burned-today-people-around-world-raised-millions-rebuild" target="_blank">
            Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been pledged for the rebuilding efforts.</a>

         <p>How the cathedral will be restored is also up for debate. On Wednesday, Prime

         <h2> Historical Importance</h2>
         <br>
         <p>Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris. It sits
            purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded by the
            Seine River. It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian monuments
            are measured.

         <br>
         <br>
         <p>Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum in Washington,
            said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most famous Gothic churches.
            “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built specifically to give a good viewing
            point,” he said. “It's not an accident that so many people have taken photographs
            of the front of the church.”
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored.
            Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed in the
            fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once officials fully
            assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.
         </p>
         <p>Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s large
            stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong case for
            restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its former glory.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Even the White House offered assistance in the rehabilitation of the cathedral.
            While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed the importance of
            considering <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-cathedral-notre-dame-de-paris/" target="_blank">how other catastrophic fires of major landmarks are handled.</a>

         <br>
         <p>In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson within
            10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe for the churches
            had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a Twitter campaign urged
            people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst the devastation of Notre Dame,
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/17/after-notre-dame-fire-gofundme-ensured-black-churches-burned-louisiana-got-million-too/" target="_blank">the total skyrocketed to $1
            million by Wednesday.</a>
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>“Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said of Notre
            Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there are other buildings
            that are important to other communities. It may not be as famous, but when tragedy
            strikes there it can be devastating to a particular community or a particular
            group of people, and sometimes it doesn't get the attention it deserves.”
