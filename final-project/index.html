        Construction is no stranger to College Park, Md. Between <a href="https://vpaf.umd.edu/current-projects/cole-field-house" style="color:#E30808;">the renovation
        of Cole Field House</a> and <a href="https://vpaf.umd.edu/current-projects/purple-line" style="color:#E30808;">the installation of the Purple Line</a>, construction
        is a part of the University of Maryland’s DNA. <a
        href="https://maps.umd.edu/PDFs/construction-activity/P&C_Construction_Activity_Map_February_2020.pdf" style="color:#E30808 ;">
        (There is even a construction activity map.)</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        It should come as no surprise then that part of Knox Road is officially
        under construction for the City Hall Project. On February 26, 2020,<a href="https://www.collegeparkmd.gov/cityhall" style="color:#E30808;">
        demolition of the shopping strip</a> that housed Subway, Shanghai Cafe,
        Hair Cuttery, and Smoothie King began.

      <p>Many students were surprised by the closing of these stores.</p>

      <p> “I am shocked and heartbroken,” said Clodagh Johnston, a senior at
         UMD and avid Subway customer. “The line in Subway
         at 2 a.m. is long. It’s not like they were not doing well business-wise.
         It was a total surprise.” </p>

      <p> <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/02/17/umd-college-park-new-city-hall-construction/" style="color:#E30808;">
        The Diamondback</a> says the building that will replace the strip is
        expected to be 95,000 square feet and will contain city hall, office
        space, a plaza, and retail. Several of the demolished shops will be redeveloped
        and re-leased once the building is complete.</p>

      <p>City Hall is currently located at 8400 Baltimore Ave., but
        not all city employees work under the same roof, according to the<a href="https://www.collegeparkmd.gov/244/City-Facilities#citybuildings" style="color:#E30808;"> City
        of College Park.</a> A new building will allow all employees to work
        together and will create a more collaborative environment.</p>

      <p> This new, modern city hall will bring more jobs to College Park and will
        further develop the downtown area. The estimated completion date will
        be some time in 2021 and is expected to cost approximately $47 million.
        This is an increase from the original estimate of $20.5 million.

      <p><a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/02/17/umd-college-park-new-city-hall-construction/" style="color:#E30808;">
        According to the Diamondback</a>, the university will pay more than two-thirds
        of the project’s cost, leaving the rest to the city to pay for.</p>

      <p>The City of College Park says officials and residents have been
        discussing an improved city hall for over 20 years.
        <a href="https://www.collegeparkmd.gov/cityhall" style="color:#E30808;">In 2014</a>, Knox Road
        became the location for the new city hall. But for many students,
        the new city hall comes as a surprise. </p>

        </div>

      <p>"I was really surprised. It didn’t really feel like there was much warning.
        They really just wiped everything out,” said Julia Kilmnick, a senior
        at UMD.</p>

      <p>Johnston thinks that the choice to not explicitly tell students about the
        store closings was strategic.</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p> “My theory is that College Park knew we would rally and prevent
        Subway from being shut down if we had known previously. That’s why they
        didn’t tell us about city hall sooner.” - Clodagh Johnston.</p>
  </blockquote>

      <p> Many students’ main point of confusion is the location of the new city hall.</p>

      <p> “I think it’s a weird place to have a city hall considering it is all
        college kids. Do you really want a city hall next to bars?” said Johnston. </p>

      <p> Kilmnick also expressed confusion about the placement. “Considering
        that’s where students normally go to eat or to the bars, it doesn’t
        make sense if it is going to be some sort of governmental establishment.
        It feels like a strange place for it.” </p>

      <p> Many have even come up with ideas for what could be included in the area,
         in addition to City Hall.</p>

      <p> “Instead, I think they could be doing more to increase the community
        aspect of the area. Like including more affordable restaurants.
        [With the demolition of Subway], there are now less affordable
        restaurants,” said Johnston.</p>

      <p> The general consensus amongst these students is negative. Many are upset
        with store closings, but the City of College Park is hoping that a new
        city hall will help contribute to making the city a sustainable
        college town.</p>
